Created an interesting and helpful musical training interface for children based on "SNAP". This project is designed as an educational GWAP that combines games and musical tutorials together helping children to learn music and play piano with our user friendly interface. Additionally built-in games featured in a kind of "Guitar Hero" style. Simple but entertaining and powerful.
