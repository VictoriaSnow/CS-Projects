/*
 * A struct that represents one quadtree node.
 * LEAF is a boolean value to denote whether this node is a leaf:
 * 0 = non-leaf, 1 = leaf. SIZE refers to the number of pixels in
 * the width of the image represented by this node. X and Y refer
 * to the coordinates of the top-left most pixel of the section.
 * GRAY_VALUE is set to a value in 0-255 for leaves, but can be
 * anything for non-leaves. The four children pointers should
 * only point to other nodes if this node is not a leaf.
